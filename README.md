# spotify_ETL
This project retrieves data from the Spotify API relevant to a users most recently played songs. This is then stored within a database following a snowflake schema. 

An OAuth token needs to be gotten from https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-recently-played/?limit=&after=&before= in order to function.
